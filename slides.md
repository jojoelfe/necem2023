# Workflows for *In-Situ* Structural Biology <br /> Using DeCo-LACE and *cis*TEM

Johannes Elferich, Grigorieff Lab


---

# *In-situ* cryo-EM

- Solve structures in thei native environment
- Quantify differences in conformational landscapes
- Quantify differences in complex formation
- Main problem is finding target
- Tomography vs 2DTM
- Data acquisition speed is crucial

---

# Data acquisition using DeCo-LACE

- Lamellae preparation is slow (Do not waste area)
- Hard to know where rare events are from overview (CLEM)
- Approach: Image everything as fast as possible

---

# Data acquisition using DeCo-LACE

- Dual images
- Napari setup
- Speed

---

# cisTEM Preprocessing - Motion correction

- crop out the beam edges

---

# cisTEM Preprocessing - CTFfind

- Thickness estimation

---

# cisTEM 2DTM - Automation with pycistem

- Commands

---

# Drug treatment of human leukemia cell line

--- 

# Molecular localization - Visualize using Blender

<!-- Animation ??-->

---

# cisTEM - Convert to a single-particle project

---

# cisTEM - Reconstruction and Template Bias

---

# cisTEM - Classification

<!-- Animation ??-->

---

# Does the drug affect the elongation cycle?

---

# Degradation in autophagosomes?

---

# Future directions
